    - This takes you to the Postman link that is a lot more user friendly.
    - It allows you to choose what language in order to call the data.
  - ### [Good Enough](https://freerandomapi.cyclic.app/)
    - This is the minimalist version of documentation! ;)

## Ideas? <a name="ideas"></a>
- I am wanting this API to be a service to all those who need it. There are a lot of free APIs out there, but either documentation or authorization are needed to access it. Sometimes in projects that need simple data from an API are what needed.
- If you have an idea you want to add to the database
  - create an **Issue** using the same formats as Issue #2
  - Tag me in the Issue
  - Include your **email or discord** so I can contact you with credentials.
  - GET STARTED!
