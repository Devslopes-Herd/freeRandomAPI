## Documentation - How to call the data? <a name="documentation"></a>
- ## You have two options:
  - ### [Much Better Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/18924529/UzR1M3Jq)
    - This takes you to the Postman link that is a lot more user friendly.
    - It allows you to choose what language in order to call the data.
  - ### [Good Enough](https://freerandomapi.herokuapp.com/)
    - This is the minimalist version of documentation! ;) 

## How to contribute? <a name="contribute"></a>
- Here is a [great link](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) that will explain step by step how to do it!
- Once you have completed the step of creating a branch you will need to contact me to get credentials to access the database. 
- ### How to reach me:
  -  Create an **ISSUE** and explaining that you need credentials. You will need to provide an **email or discord** in the **issue** in order for me to send you the credentials.

## Ideas? <a name="ideas"></a>
- I am wanting this API to be a service to all those who need it. The reason I created this project was because I saw a need in the program I am in. There are a lot of free APIs out there, but either documentation or authorization are needed to access it. Sometimes in projects that need simple data from an API are what needed. Eventually this will build to more exciting information for more complex problems, but for now this will do!
- If you have an idea you want to contribute in our next feature, create an **ISSUE** and I will do my best to help!
